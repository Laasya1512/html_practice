<h2>History:</h2>
<p>Mysore was ruled by the demon-king Mahishasura, he was a buffalo-headed monster. Hence, came the name of this place - Mahishuru, the city of demon Mahisha. 
 The demon was killed by the Goddess Chamundeshwari, whose temple is situated atop the Chamundi Hills. 
 Mahishuru later became Mahisuru and finally came to be called Maisuru, its present name in the Kannada language. The anglicised form of the name is Mysore.</p>

<h2>Wodeyars: </h2>
<p>As the History of Mysore went under the control of the Britishers, they placed a minor Prince Krishnaraja Wodeyar on the throne of Mysore. 
  It was practically from this time that the city started to grow. 
  During the reign of Mummadi Krishna Raja Wodeyar(Krishna Raja Wodeyar III) the town of Mysore expanded and moved beyond the walls of the fort. 
  H.H. Chamaraja Wodeyar adopted son of Mummadi Krishna Raja Wodeyar , succeeded him and ruled Mysore Kingdom form 1881 to 1894. 
  H.H. Nalvadi Krishna Raja Wodeyar(Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV) eldest son Mummadi Krishna Raja Wodeyar, ruled mysore from 1895-1940 and 
  developed Mysore into a beautiful city with excellent planning. Under his reign Mysore became famous for its wide roads, magnificent building and elegant parks.
  During Nalvadi Krishna Raja Wodeyar's minority his mother H.H. Vani Vilas Sannidhana ruled as regent from 1895-1902.</p>
<br><br>

<h2>After British:</h2>
  <p>Even after British India gained Independent dominion status on 15-8-1947, Mysore continued as a Sovereign State under the 
    Maharaja H.H. Jaya Chamaraja Wodeyar albeit with a responsible Government headed by Mr. K.C. Reddy as the Chief Minister. 
    However, the Constituent Assembly of Mysore decided to adopt the Constitution of India and on 26-1-1950, Mysore merged with the Republic of India as a Part -B State.
    But the Maharaja Continued as the Rajpramukh of the State as per Art. 366(21) of the Constitution.
